    Types of Software Development Projects
    A software development company is typically structured into a large
    number of teams that handle various types of software development
    projects. These software development projects concern the
    development of either software product or some software service. In
    the following subsections, we distinguish between these two types of
    software development projects.
    Software products
    We all know of a variety of software such as Microsoftâ€™s Windows and the
    Office suite, Oracle DBMS, software accompanying a camcorder or a
    laser printer, etc. These software are available off-the-shelf for
    purchase and are used by a diverse range of customers. These are
    called generic software products since many users essentially use the
    same software. These can be purchased off-the-shelf by the customers.
    When a software development company wishes to develop a generic
    product, it first determines the features or functionalities that would be
    useful to a large cross section of users. Based on these, the
    development team draws up the product specification on its own. Of
    course, it may base its design discretion on feedbacks collected from a
    large number of users. Typically, eac h software product is targetted to
    some market segment (set of users). Many companies find it
    advantageous to develop product lines that target slightly different
    market segments based on variations of essentially the same software.
    For example, Microsoft targets desktops and laptops through its
    Windows 8 operating system, while it targets high-end mobile handsets
    through i t s Windows mobile operating system, and targets servers
    through its Windows server operating system.
    Software services
    A software service usually involves either development of a customised
    software or development of some specific part of a software in an
    outsourced mode. A customised software is developed according to the
    specification drawn up by one or at most a few customers. These need
    to be developed in a short time frame (typically a couple of months),
    and at the same time the development cost must be low. Usually, a
    developing company develops customised software by tailoring some of
    its existing software. For example, when an academic institution wishes
    to have a software that would automate its important activities such as
    student registration, grading, and fee collection; companies would
    normally develop such a software as a customised product. This means
    that for developing a customised software, the developing company
    would normally tailor one of its existing software products that it might
    have developed in the past for some other academic institution.
    In a customised software development project, a large part of the software
    is reused from the code of related software that the company might have
    already developed. Usually, only a small part of the software that is specific
    to some client is developed. For example, suppose a software development
    organisation has developed an academic automation software that
    automates the student registration, grading, Establishment, hostel and other
    aspects of an academic institution. When a new educational institution
    requests for developing a software for automation of its activities, a large
    part of the existing software would be reused. However, a small part of the
    existing code may be modified to take into account small variations in the
    required features. For example, a software might have been developed for an
    academic institute that offers only regular residential programs, the
    educational institute that has now requested for a software to automate its
    activities also offers a distance mode post graduate program where the
    teaching and sessional evaluations are done by the local centres.
    Another type of software service i s outsourced software. Sometimes, it can
    make good commercial sense for a company developing a large project to
    outsource some parts of its development work to other companies. The
    reasons behind such a decision may be many. For example, a company might
    consider the outsourcing option, if it feels that it does not have sufficient
    expertise to develop some specific parts of the software; or if it determines
    that some parts can be developed cost-effectively by another company. Since
    an outsourced project i s a small part of some larger project, outsourced
    projects are usually small in size and need to be completed within a few
    months or a few weeks of time.
    The types of development projects that are being undertaken by a
    company can have an impact on its profitability. For example, a company that
    has developed a generic software product usually gets an uninterrupted
    stream of revenue that is spread over several years. However, this entails
    substantial upfront investment in developing the software and any return on
    this investment is subject to the risk of customer acceptance. On the other
    hand, outsourced projects are usually less risky, but fetch only one time
    revenue to the developing company."""
