    "Types of Software Development Projects\n",
    "A software development company is typically structured into a large\n",
    "number of teams that handle various types of software development\n",
    "projects. These software development projects concern the\n",
    "development of either software product or some software service. In\n",
    "the following subsections, we distinguish between these two types of\n",
    "software development projects.\n",
    "Software products\n",
    "We all know of a variety of software such as Microsoft’s Windows and the\n",
    "Office suite, Oracle DBMS, software accompanying a camcorder or a\n",
    "laser printer, etc. These software are available off-the-shelf for\n",
    "purchase and are used by a diverse range of customers. These are\n",
    "called generic software products since many users essentially use the\n",
    "same software. These can be purchased off-the-shelf by the customers.\n",
    "When a software development company wishes to develop a generic\n",
    "product, it first determines the features or functionalities that would be\n",
    "useful to a large cross section of users. Based on these, the\n",
    "development team draws up the product specification on its own. Of\n",
    "course, it may base its design discretion on feedbacks collected from a\n",
    "large number of users. Typically, eac h software product is targetted to\n",
    "some market segment (set of users). Many companies fin d it\n",
    "advantageous to develop product lines that target slightly different\n",
    "market segments based on variations of essentially the same software.\n",
    "For example, Microsoft targets desktops and laptops through its\n",
    "Windows 8 operating system, while it targets high-end mobile handsets\n",
    "through i t s Windows mobile operating system, and targets servers\n",
    "through its Windows server operating system.\n",
    "Software services\n",
    "A software service usually involves either development of a customised\n",
    "software or development of some specific part of a software in an\n",
    "outsourced mode. A customised software is developed according to the\n",
    "specification drawn up by one or at most a few customers. These need\n",
    "to be developed in a short time frame (typically a couple of months),\n",
    "and at the same time the development cost must be low. Usually, a\n",
    "developing company develops customised software by tailoring some of\n",
    "its existing software. For example, when an academic institution wishes\n",
    "to have a software that would automate its important activities such as\n",
    "student registration, grading, and fee collection; companies would\n",
    "normally develop such a software as a customised product. This means\n",
    "that for developing a customised software, the developing company\n",
    "would normally tailor one of its existing software products that it might\n",
    "have developed in the past for some other academic institution.\n",
    "In a customised software development project, a large part of the software\n",
    "is reused from the code of related software that the company might have\n",
    "already developed. Usually, only a small part of the software that is specific\n",
    "to some client is developed. For example, suppose a software development\n",
    "organisation has developed an academic automation software that\n",
    "automates the student registration, grading, Establishment, hostel and other\n",
    "aspects of an academic institution. When a new educational institution\n",
    "requests for developing a software for automation of its activities, a large\n",
    "part of the existing software would be reused. However, a small part of the\n",
    "existing code may be modified to take into account small variations in the\n",
    "required features. For example, a software might have been developed for an\n",
    "academic institute that offers only regular residential programs, the\n",
    "educational institute that has now requested for a software to automate its\n",
    "activities also offers a distance mode post graduate program where the\n",
    "teaching and sessional evaluations are done by the local centres.\n",
    "Another type of software service i s outsourced software. Sometimes, it can\n",
    "make good commercial sense for a company developing a large project to\n",
    "outsource some parts of its development work to other companies. The\n",
    "reasons behind such a decision may be many. For example, a company might\n",
    "consider the outsourcing option, if it feels that it does not have sufficient\n",
    "expertise to develop some specific parts of the software; or if it determines\n",
    "that some parts can be developed cost-effectively by another company. Since\n",
    "an outsourced project i s a small part of some larger project, outsourced\n",
    "projects are usually small in size and need to be completed within a few\n",
    "months or a few weeks of time.\n",
    "The types of development projects that are being undertaken by a\n",
    "company can have an impact on its profitability. For example, a company that\n",
    "has developed a generic software product usually gets an uninterrupted\n",
    "stream of revenue that is spread over several years. However, this entails\n",
    "substantial upfront investment in developing the software and any return on\n",
    "this investment is subject to the risk of customer acceptance. On the other\n",
    "hand, outsourced projects are usually less risky, but fetch only one time\n",
    "revenue to the developing company.\"\"\"\n",
